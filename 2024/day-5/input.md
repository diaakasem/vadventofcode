## \-\-\- Day 3: Mull It Over ---

"Our computers are having issues, so I have no idea if we have any Chief Historians in stock! You're welcome to check the warehouse, though," says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the [North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop](/2020/day/2). The Historians head out to take a look.

The shopkeeper turns to you. "Any chance you can see why our computers are having issues again?"

The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is _corrupted_. All of the instructions have been jumbled up!

It seems like the goal of the program is just to _multiply some numbers_. It does that with instructions like `mul(X,Y)`, where `X` and `Y` are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance, `mul(44,46)` multiplies `44` by `46` to get a result of `2024`. Similarly, `mul(123,4)` would multiply `123` by `4`.

However, because the program's memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be _ignored_, even if they look like part of a `mul` instruction. Sequences like `mul(4*`, `mul(6,9!`, `?(12,34)`, or `mul ( 2 , 4 )` do _nothing_.

For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:

```
x<em>mul(2,4)</em>%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_<em>mul(5,5)</em>+mul(32,64]then(<em>mul(11,8)mul(8,5)</em>)
```

Only the four highlighted sections are real `mul` instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces `<em>161</em>` ( `2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5`).

Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted `mul` instructions. _What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?_
